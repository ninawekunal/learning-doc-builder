## The big picture

> [!TERMS]
> - **Header filter** - a filter you open by clicking a column's title, like in a spreadsheet.
> - **Popover** - a small floating panel that opens next to what you clicked.
> - **Draft** - your in-progress choices inside the popover, not yet applied.
> - **Commit / Apply** - turning the draft into the real filter the table uses.
> - **Chips** - small removable tags under the toolbar, one per active filter.
> - **Serializer** - a function that turns an object into text, here the `?key=value` part of a URL.
> - **ISO date** - a date written as `2026-09-17`, year first.

> [!TLDR]
> Click a column title to filter it; a small separate button sorts it.
> Each popover keeps a draft and applies it once on "Apply".
> One filter object, owned by the page, feeds every place that shows or changes filters.

![The Trade orders blotter with filterable column headers: each filterable title has a funnel and a separate sort button, and plain headers sit at the same height](images/07-column-header-filters-popover/default.png "The orders table with filterable headers: each title has a funnel and its own small sort button.")

Everyone who has used a spreadsheet knows the move: click the column header, tick two values, done.
A header filter sits right where your eyes already are, so nobody has to translate "this column" into "that field in a form".

Table: each row is a place in the UI, what it reads from the filter object, and what it may change.

| Place | Reads | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header popovers | Its own filter key | Its own key, on Apply |
| "All filters" panel | A draft copy of everything | Everything, on Apply |
| Chips row | Every active filter | Removes one value |
| URL, data request, export | Everything, through one serializer | - |

> [!NUANCE]
> Header filters are the wrong tool for "working orders OR anything from my desk" (that crosses columns) and for saved views (those belong in the toolbar).

> [!RECAP]
> - Filter from the column title; sort from a small separate button.
> - One filter object feeds every place that shows filters.

## Decide the shape of the filters first

> [!TLDR]
> Before any UI, write one plain object with one key per thing a user can narrow.
> Only strings, numbers, lists of strings and `null`, so it survives being put into a URL and read back.

```ts
export type OrderFilters = {
  symbols: string[];
  statuses: OrderStatus[];
  quantityMin: number | null;
  quantityMax: number | null;
  submittedFrom: string | null; // "2026-09-17"
  submittedTo: string | null;
};
```

> [!NUANCE]
> - Count active filters by group: a minimum and a maximum together count as one filter.
> - No `Date` objects in here. Dates are text; `Date` only exists inside the date picker.

> [!RECAP]
> - Design the filter object first: plain values only.
> - Count a min and max together as one filter.

## The filter header

> [!TLDR]
> One click target cannot mean both "sort" and "filter".
> Sorting is one click, so it can live on a small button.
> Filtering takes several steps, so it gets the big target: the title.

> [!STEPS]
> 1. **The title opens the popover.** The popover can close itself after Apply, and knows when it is open so it can load options.
> 2. **The funnel shows the state.** Grey when off; the title turns coloured with a count badge when on.
> 3. **Sort gets its own small button**, which shows the direction, because a column can be sorted and filtered at once.
> 4. **Each popover chooses where the cursor starts**, so keyboard users land on the right control.

> [!NUANCE]
> - Do not add an `aria-label` to a button that already shows text. It replaces what screen readers and voice control hear. Add extra words in hidden text instead, so it reads "Status, filter, 2 active".
> - A table that is filtered but does not look filtered reads as missing data.

![Orders blotter with the Symbol popover open under its title, the sort icon button beside the title and the option list loaded](images/07-column-header-filters-popover/symbol-popover-open.png "The Symbol filter open under its column title, with the full option list.")

> [!RECAP]
> - The title opens the filter; the funnel shows whether it is on.
> - Do not override visible text with an aria-label.

## Draft, Apply, Clear

> [!TLDR]
> If every tick applied immediately, four ticks would mean four server requests and four Back-button steps.
> So each popover keeps a draft, applies it once, and throws it away on Escape or a click outside.

> [!ANALOGY]
> It is a shopping basket, not a vending machine.
> You gather what you want, then pay once at the till.

![Committing on every tick fires one request and one history entry per tick, while a draft that commits on Apply fires one request, and Escape or an outside click discards the draft by unmounting the body](images/07-column-header-filters-popover/draft-apply-commit.png "Applying every tick sends a request each time; a draft sends one on Apply, and Escape throws it away.")

> [!NUANCE]
> - No special reset code is needed. The popover's content is removed when it closes, so next time it starts fresh from the applied filter.
> - A popover's "Clear" clears only its own draft. "Clear all" lives with the chips. Mixing them up confuses people.

> [!RECAP]
> - Keep a draft, apply once, discard on Escape.
> - A popover Clear clears only its draft.

## Long option lists, ranges and dates

> [!TLDR]
> Long lists load from the server the first time a popover opens, and come from **all** the user's data, not the filtered rows.
> Number ranges keep what was typed as text until Apply.
> Dates only become `Date` objects inside the calendar.

> [!NUANCE]
> - If options came from the filtered rows, picking one symbol would leave only that symbol to pick.
> - Put already-applied items at the top of the list - using the applied value, not the draft, or rows jump under the cursor as you tick.
> - Let "nvidia" find `NVDA` by giving each option extra search words.
> - If the options fail to load, say so and offer a retry. An empty list means "nothing exists", which is a different fact.
> - A half-typed number like "1e" is not a number yet, so keep the text and check it each time, instead of storing a number.

> [!GOTCHA]
> `new Date("2026-09-17")` means midnight in **UTC**, the world's reference clock - which is still the evening of the 16th in New York.
> So the calendar highlights the wrong day for American users.
> Build dates from year, month and day in local time, store plain `2026-09-17` text, and let the server decide when a trading day starts.

> [!RECAP]
> - Load long option lists on first open, from all the user's data.
> - Keep half-typed numbers as text.
> - Never turn a date string into a Date outside the calendar.

## One object, many places

> [!TLDR]
> The usual bug is two places disagreeing: a chip says one thing and a header badge another.
> The fix is to have only one copy, so there is nothing to keep in sync.

![The page owns one OrderFilters object that header popovers, the All filters panel and the chips row read and write, and one serializer turns it into the URL, the list request, the CSV link and the query key](images/07-column-header-filters-popover/one-filter-object.png "The page owns one filter object; headers, the panel and chips all read and write it, and it becomes the URL.")

> [!STEPS]
> 1. **The page owns the object** and shares it, plus one `updateFilters` function, with everything below it.
> 2. **`updateFilters` also resets to page 1**, because page 7 of the full list does not exist in a list of 12.
> 3. **Chips are worked out from the object**, each knowing how to remove only its own value.
> 4. **The "All filters" panel keeps its own draft** too, applied once.

> [!NUANCE]
> - Share the object through React context rather than rebuilding the columns with it. Rebuilt columns make every header restart, closing any open popover.

![Blotter with Symbol, Status and Quantity badges active, the matching chips row, and the All filters sheet open showing the same symbols, status and minimum quantity](images/07-column-header-filters-popover/all-filters-panel.png "The All filters panel open, showing the same choices as the header badges and chips.")

> [!RECAP]
> - One copy of the filters means nothing can disagree.
> - updateFilters also resets to page 1.

## Into the URL and to the server

> [!TLDR]
> One function writes the filters into the URL; one schema reads them back - in the browser and on the server.

> [!NUANCE]
> - Always write the same filters the same way: skip defaults, fixed key order, sorted lists. Then "NVDA then AAPL" and "AAPL then NVDA" make the same URL and share a cache.
> - Someone can type anything into a URL. A nonsense value like `?status=banana` should quietly mean "no status filter", not an error page.
> - The data request, the preload and the export link all use the same writer, so the export always matches the screen.
> - For a table whose rows are all in the browser, TanStack's own column filters work well and give you option counts for free.
> - For a server table, TanStack's filter state is just an extra, untyped layer to translate in and out of. Skip it.

> [!INTERVIEW]
> - *What did an unused filter API teach?* A shared table kit shipped a second filter API that no page ever used, and it became dead code. Build the shared version after the second real use, not before the first.

Table: each row is a styling rule for filter headers and popovers.

| Styling rule | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Filter headers and plain headers | Same height and text size |
| Popover widths | Narrower for a list, wider for a range, auto for the calendar |
| Alignment | Popover's left edge lines up with its title |
| Focus ring | Keep it; draw it inside if the sticky header clips it |

> [!WIN]
> Filter from the title, sort from a small button, draft and apply once - and every chip, badge, URL and export agrees, because there is only one filter object.

> [!RECAP]
> - One function writes the URL and one schema reads it, on both ends.
> - Nonsense URL values quietly mean "no filter".

## Summary

> [!SUMMARY]
> - Put filters on the column title and sorting on a small button.
> - Draft inside the popover and apply once.
> - Load options lazily from all the user's data, and keep dates as text.
> - One page-owned filter object, one way to write it into the URL, one schema to read it back.
